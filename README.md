==========
The uniconnect project

Connect with YOUR “Alumni”!<br/>
Connect with YOUR “Peers”!<br/>
Connect with YOUR “Faculty”!<br/>
We provide you complete exclusivity!<br/><br/>

What it is?<br/>
The project is an organization/university specific "question-answer" private forum where the alumni, the experienced, the expert help the new, the unaware, the immature.<br/>
We do not only aim at providing a platform that supports such a service, but also try to conduce such culture.<br/><br/>

Key points/ Features:<br/>
Organization/University specific Q/A forum to help people especially students ask questions, especially, related to their career/academic path.<br/>
Private forums accessible only to registered users: current and past members.<br/>
Questions categorize as "what","when","how","where" or "others" and also associate "tags" with a question. This is to enhance search.<br/>
Anonymity: for difficult questions and answers.<br/>
A public forum for each organization is also available.<br/>
Extending to: build a search engine for questions and “suggest” existing similar questions before letting the user post his question".<br/><br/>

Technical aspects:<br/>
1. We used PHP, mongodb, html, css and jquery.<br/>
2. Amazon ec2 cloud server to host a web server and a database server.<br/>
3. Extend by using Apache Solr to develop a search engine for the questions and "suggest existing similar questions.<br/><br/>


Motivation:<br/>
What is the one thing that is constant in our lives? That never dies out no matter where or what or who we are - curiosity, questions - where we are going or what we are doing? Questions, and thus choices, become important when we are in between a change, whether the reason be a new university or a new job or even be a new country. Advice best when comes from a person with similar background. Hence we focus on alumni.<br/>
We build this forum on a philosophy that there are 'no stupid question'. We do encourage users to research the problem themselves. But, whatever question that is posted must be answered.<br/>
Privacy discourages spams, creates an environment of belongingness.<br/><br/>

Existing solutions:<br/>
A Facebook group or any other forum for questions. The present solutions, like Facebook does not provide a portal where threads are maintained, or could be searched. Or like other forums, where questions are too many to be relevant to a specific users. Too much information - that discourages answers, thus, questions.<br/><br/>
